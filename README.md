# The Cat Platformer

---

## Overview

**The Cat Platformer** is a 2D platformer game originally created as a personal gift for an online friend who loves cats, memes, and video games. What started as a small passion project quickly grew into something I am genuinely proud of and decided to include in my portfolio.

The game was developed in **five days**, and while it does not follow perfect architectural practices, it demonstrates creativity, rapid problem-solving, and the ability to turn an idea into a fully playable experience within a short timeframe.

## Project Background

This project was initially never intended for public release. Development was done rapidly, resulting in a monolithic structure where most of the game mechanics were implemented in a single file. At the time, the goal was to build a short mini-game rather than a full project.

As development progressed, the project evolved into a complete experience featuring a short story, a boss fight, and a clear objective. The game draws inspiration from **Terraria**, **Mario**, and various cat memes commonly seen across social media platforms.

Although the game still contains known bugs and areas for improvement, it stands as a completed project that reflects growth, experimentation, and commitment to finishing what was started.
